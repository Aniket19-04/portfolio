            Hey there, my name is Aniket Kumar, I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer and this portfolio represents my skills
            and accomplishments. I'm a web developer and I want to make websites for companies. As of now, I'm an
            engineering student. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 0.4em;"> The skills which I've acquired in my path of learning web development are-:
        <ul style="font-size: 0.4em;">
            <li style="list-style: circle;">HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
            <li>MERN STACK</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 0.4em;">
            I've faced some small and big problems while learning web development and tried my level best to overcome
            them,
            and in this process of learning and correcting myself I've grown a deep interest in web development and now
            I
            love to enjoy making websites though speaking frankly I still face problems, which is no doubt a part of
            learning.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 0.4em;"> my career field right I haven't done the internships, but yes I've made some
            fascinating projects which I
            guess you have already seen in my portfolio, and I've also been on the web team of clubs of my college, and
            now I'm looking forward to take my skills to another level by applying to internships.
        </p>
